# Changelog

All notable changes to **Nassila** are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.1] — 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- **More** menu closes when you click outside or choose an action (replaces native `<details>` that stayed open).
- **Import** (and other toolbar) hints dismiss when the pointer leaves the button, including after the file dialog closes.
- **Vancouver:** citation cards show six authors then “et al.” when there are seven or more; removed a validator rule that incorrectly flagged full author lists as “Needs fix” (export via CSL was already correct).

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-24

Reference list verification baseline.

### Added

- Desktop app: import and validate bibliographies (BibTeX, RIS, CSL-JSON, plain text, DOCX/PDF extraction where supported).
- Unified registry verify (Crossref, PubMed, OpenAlex): L1 resolution + L2 metadata alignment (up to 200 rows per run).
- Autocorrect, duplicate detection, predatory-journal flags, CSL export (thousands of styles).
- English and Arabic UI with bilingual product positioning.

### Notes

- Manuscript audit / L3 grounding UI is not enabled in this release; engine code remains for a later phase.
- Windows `appId`: `com.nassila.app`.
